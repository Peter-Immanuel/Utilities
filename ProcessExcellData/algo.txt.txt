algorithm
- Iterate through the date column
  and obtain the index of every space within the column
  store that index in a list

using the indexes:
    split the dataframe-> this should give the dataset for each month 
    e.g for the first month it would be start to index and the next 
    month will be previous index to next index

- compute the individual call dropped and find their value DCR 
- compute the individual call successrate and find their value
- compute the last required field and get its value 

update this values to a dictionary with key as the month
